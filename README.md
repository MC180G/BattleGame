# BattleGame

A turn-based, attack/defense game using Javascript and jQuery.

The art design is based on the James Gunn film The Belko Experiment, where random office workers are forced to fight each other.

The user chooses an avatar from four characters and the remaining characters act as Defenders. The user chooses each defender one at a time until the remaining three are likley defeated.
